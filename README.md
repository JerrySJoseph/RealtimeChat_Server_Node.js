# Realtime Chat Server 
This is an open-source project for implementing realtime chat application in any platform using Websockets. It implements Websocket via Socket.io library. An instance of this server is hosted in the cloud for demonstration. This server facilitates mutltiple rooms supervised by server. Each user needs to enter username and room id the join the room. Joining the session is done by initialising a socket at this server's ENDPOINT.

# EVENTS
Getting online Users
```javascript
 socket.on('users', ({ online }) => {
           //A destructured object named online is used to fetch list of online users;
           users=[];
           users.concat(online);

        })
```
Recieving messages
```javascript
  socket.on('message', ({ message, room, from }) => {
            //display the recieved message in console
            console.log(from + ":" + message + " in " + room);
            
        })
```
Send Messages
```javascript
 sendMessage(newmes) {
        console.log("Sending message " + newmes)
        if (newmsg) {
            socket.emit('sendMessage', socket.id, room, newmes, ({ status }) => {
                //A status is recieved as callback from server if message is delivered successfully
                if (status !== "success")
                    alert(status);
                    //TODO: Clear input
            });
        }
    }
```
